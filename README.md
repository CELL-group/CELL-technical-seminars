# The CELL single-cell omics analysis group

## [Technical seminars](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/CELL-technical-seminars/wiki/References#single-cell-group-talks)
The Curie-ESPCI-Ligue Contre le Cancer (CELL) single-cell analysis group organizes technical seminars once a month to discuss methodological aspects of single cell -omics data analysis. The [CELL seminar series](https://github.com/CELL-group/CELL-technical-seminars/wiki/References#single-cell-group-talks) is organised by Aurélien de Reynies (Ligue Contre le Cancer), Josh Waterfall (Institut Curie), Mathieu Bahin (startup Minos Biosciences), Pacôme Prompsy (Institut Curie) and Louisa Hadj Abed (Institut Curie).

Our aim is to create a friendly community to improve the quality of our single cell analyses and to promote more formal collaborations within the group.  Biological context of particular projects is important to describe, but the point of this series is to focus on the computational analysis methods, not the biology. We acknowledge that many times in research things do not work and so strongly encourage people to share negative, as well as positive, data such that we can all learn from it. These meetings are open to all and are a rotating schedule of talks which follow a defined format: 

**1)	Methodology:** A short presentation comparing state of the art computational methods and if possible benchmarking data to perform a single aspect of single cell analysis such as data normalization. 

**2)	Troubleshooting:** We can often can get stuck on a particular analysis problem and need help to solve it. This is an open meeting where people can present a problem they are stuck on and we troubleshoot together as a group. For example having difficulties integrating data from different patients or having issues getting an algorithm to run successfully

**3)	Pipeline/Method review:** If someone is finishing a paper and would like to present their bioinformatics pipeline/new method to the rest of the group for feedback. This talk should focus on technical aspects of the pipeline/method and less about the scientific outputs. E.g. if you perform pseudotime analysis of your data you should discuss why you chose algorithm X rather than algorithm Y. 

**4)	Open format:** This broader category may comprise one of the following 
a.	Journal club presentation
b.	MSc. student presentations
c.	Annual review of the major technical advances in the field from the previous 12 months and highlight technologies to look out for in the coming 12 months.

Lastly, we are very fortunate to host internationally renowned speakers throughout the year and organize informal but technically focused discussions about single cell data analysis over coffee.

## [Know-how resource](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/CELL-technical-seminars/wiki)
The CELL group maintains a [know-how wiki](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/State-of-the-art-analyses/wiki) about state of the art for the different single-cell usual analysis steps.

## [Member bio's](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/CELL-technical-seminars/wiki/Biographies)
A list of all contributors to the group with a short bio of their experience and expertise, as well as contact details and links to their code repositories.

## [Discussion space](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/State-of-the-art-analyses/discussions)
A space to ask questions in a less formal format than the repo [issues](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/CELL-technical-seminars/issues).

## Dev/benchmark
At some point, task forces might address a specific issue. Each of them should be treated in a dedicated project repo and compared on identified reference [datasets](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/CELL-technical-seminars/wiki/References#dataset-resources).
