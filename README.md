# State-of-the-art-analyses
Single-cell OPEN group [wiki](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/State-of-the-art-analyses/wiki) about state of the art for the different single-cell usual analysis steps.

Objectives:
* Analytical steps for single cell omics with consensual best practices: share a know-how to choose the appropriate method for each objective.
* Analytical steps for single cell omics without consensual best practices:
** Identify needs for new developments/benchmarking
** Create task forces to address specific problems

Format:
* [Regular meetings](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/State-of-the-art-analyses/issues)
* Discussion space: [issues](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/State-of-the-art-analyses/issues)
* Know-how resource: [wiki](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/State-of-the-art-analyses/wiki)
* Dev/benchmark resource: [datasets](https://github.com/single-cell-OPEN-group/State-of-the-art-analyses/issues) and GitHub repos
